# Garry


Garry is a discord.py bot created as a hobby. This bot contains the basics for now but will likely expand in the future.

## Prerequisites

To use Garry you will need Python and some additional libraries installed.

**Python** - You can install this from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

**Pillow** - (Used for the level progress bar image)
```bash
pip install pillow
```
## Installation

Before running the bot, ensure you have run the **setup.py** script. This script will create a **config.py** file and a **levels.db** file.

The **config.py** file is where you will store your bot token for running the bot. You will need to edit this file once created and paste in your token.

```python
#Tokens
token = '<Your Discord App Token>'
```

The **levels.db** file will be used to store the discord users level data, the setup script will create all the necessary tables and you should not need to mess with this.

## Usage

Run **Main.py** in a bash or terminal window
